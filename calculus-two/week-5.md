# Week 5 - Power Series

## Definition

* A **power series** is a series of the form \\[\sum_{n=0}^{\infty}c_n x^n = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + c_3 x^3 + \cdots\\] where **x** is a variable and the \\(c_n\\)â€™s are constants called the **coefficients** of the series.
* The sum of the series is a function \\[f(x) = c_0 + c_1 x + c_2 x^2 + \cdots + c_n x^n + \cdots \\] whose domain is the set of all x for which the series converges. Notice that \\(f\\) resembles a polynomial.

## Convergence of Power Series

### Theorem

* Suppose \\(\displaystyle \sum_{n = 0}^{\infty} a_n x^n\\) converge when \\(x = x_0\\), then the series converge absolutely for \\([-x, x)\\)

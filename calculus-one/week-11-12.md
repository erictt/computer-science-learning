## Antiderivatives

* Anti-differentiation is a bridge between the differentiation and the integration. 
* **Theorem** If \\(f\\) is an antiderivative of \\(f\\) on an interval **I**, then the most general antiderivative of \\(f\\) on **I** is \\(F(x) + C\\) where **C** is an arbitrary constant.

* **the sum of antiderivatives**
    * \\(\int(f(x) +g(x)) dx = \int(f(x)) dx + \int(g(x) dx\\)
* The antiderivative of \\(f(mx+b)\\)
    * \\(\int f(mx+b) dx = \dfrac{F(mx+b)}{m} + C\\)

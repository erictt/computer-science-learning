# Unit 1: Thinking about multivariable functions

## What are multivariable functions?

* A function is called **multivariable** if its input is made up of multiple numbers. \\[\underbrace{f(x, y)}_{\text{Multiple numbers in the input} } = x^2 y\\]
* A function with single-number inputs and a single-number outputs is called a **single-variable function**.
* If the output of a function consists of multiple numbers are called **vector-valued functions**. \\[f(x) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(x) \\ \sin(x) \end{bmatrix} \gets \text{Multiple numbers in output}\\]
* functions with a single number as their output are called either **scalar-valued**, as is common in engineering, or **real-valued**, as is common is pure math (real as in real number).

### Parametric Equation

* A parametric equation defines a group of quantities as functions of one or more independent variables called parameters. Parametric equations are commonly used to express the coordinates of the points that make up a geometric object such as a curve or surface.
* Finding a parametric function that describes a curve is called **parameterizing** that curve. 
* **Note:** When you are parameterizing a curve, you must not only specify the parametric function, but also the range of input values that will draw the curve. 
* For example: \\(f(x) = \begin{bmatrix} t \cos(t) \\ t \sin(t)\end{bmatrix}\\)

## Five different visualizations

* Graphs: single-variable functions and multivariable functions with a **two**-dimensional input and a **one**-dimensional output.
* Contour maps. Contour maps only show the input space and are useful for functions with a **two**-dimensional input and a **one**-dimensional output.
* Parametric curves/surfaces. Parametric curves and surfaces only show the **output space** and are used for functions whose output space has more dimensions than the input space.
    * For example: \\(f(x) = \begin{bmatrix} \cos(t) - 3 + \frac{1}{2\pi} t\\ t \sin(t)\end{bmatrix}, t \in [0, 12 \pi]\\)

* Vector fields. These apply to functions whose input space and output space have the **same number of dimensions**.
* Transformations. These have the benefit of applying to any function, **no matter the dimension** of the input and output space. However, the downside is that they are **impractical** for representing the function precisely.

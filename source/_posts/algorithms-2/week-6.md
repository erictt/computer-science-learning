# Reductions & Linear Programming & Intractability

## Reductions

* **Def**. Problem X **reduces to** problem Y if you can use an algorithm that solves Y to help solve X.

    * ex1. find the median of N items: sort N items and return the on in the middle.
        * The cost os soloving finding the median is $N\log{N} + 1$. *1 is the cost of reductions.*

### Design Algorithms

* Mentality.
    * Since I know how to solve Y, can I use that algorithm to solve X ?
    * Programmerâ€™s version: I have code for Y. Can I use it for X?
* Examples:
    * Convex hull
        * Given N points in the plane, identify the extreme points of the convex hull (in counterclockwise order).

        * Solution
            * Graham scan.
                * Choose point p with smallest (or largest) y-coordinate. 
                * Sort points by polar angle with p to get simple polygon. 
                * Consider points in order, and discard those that would create a clockwise turn.

                * Cost: $N \log{N} + N$ <-- N is the cost of reduction

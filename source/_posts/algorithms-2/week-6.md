# Reductions & Linear Programming & Intractability

## Reductions

* **Def**. Problem X **reduces to** problem Y if you can use an algorithm that solves Y to help solve X.
    * ![](/images/16466650438708.jpg)
    * ex1. find the median of N items: sort N items and return the on in the middle.
        * The cost os soloving finding the median is $N\log{N} + 1$. *1 is the cost of reductions.*

### Design Algorithms

* Mentality.
    * Since I know how to solve Y, can I use that algorithm to solve X ?
    * Programmerâ€™s version: I have code for Y. Can I use it for X?
